# CS-300

#What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
A list of courses needed to be stored with all relevant data for each course, including course number and prerequisite courses. The list of courses then needed to be sorted by course number. It also needed to search for a specific course by number and print all relevant data.

#How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
The solution used a Biinary Search Tree data structure which made it easier for the program to print the course list in order. Searching for a specific course using a BST is faster than other types of data structures which also contributed to the decision to use a BST.

#How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
The largest challenge I faced while while finding this solution was researching multiple data structures enough to understand their benefits in order to make an informed decision for which one to use for this particular problem. Aside from that I has the usual hiccups whle coding where minor adjustments needed to be made to get the program to output the correct data. In both these cases perserverance was key.

#How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Beginning to learn about data structures is very important because it allows for a program to store more complex data objects in large quantities. Understanding the advantages and disadvantages of each data structure allows for informed decisions to create programs that are more efficient with time, space, or both depending on the needs of the solution.

#How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The larger the programs that I work on the more important it becomes to write consistent code. It becomes crucial to be able to understand the code and add or change it as necessary. This is important not just for me to be able to go back to code I have written but for others who may work with that code.
